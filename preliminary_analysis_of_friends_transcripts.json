It consists, namely, of\ntranscripts of all episodes from all seasons of one of my favorite TV series,\n[Friends][friends_wiki].\n\n[TOC]\n\n# Dataset\nThe aforementioned dataset, consists of transcripts, spread across\na nested structure of seasons, episodes, and scenes. Each scene, naturally,\ncontains a sequence of lines, by characters predominantly addressing each\nother. For examples, here's a simplified example of a scene:\n```text\n[Scene: A Park, Alice and Bob are having a picnic.]\nAlice: We're quite lucky with the weather today, aren't we?\nBob: Indeed, we are.\n```\n\n# Methodology\nThe focus of this study is to investigate two proxies of character importances,\nnamely, total number of lines alloted, and sum of the lengths[^line_length] of\nall lines alloted, for each individual season.\n\n[^line_length]: While, line length can be viewed as a form of a proxy for total\namount of screen time alloted to a given character, please, note that in this\nstudy the actual temporal dimension was not considered in any way whatsoever.\nFor completeness, line length is defined as the total number of characters -\nincluding punctuation (which is assumed to account for additional screen time) -\ncomprising a given character line. And line, itself, is defined as a contiguous\narray of sentences, alloted to a a set of characters (usually, a single\ncharacter).\n\nOf course, given the raw nature of the unprocessed data, the aforementioned metrics\nare only approximations. Nevertheless their degree of significance is strong enough\nfor the purposes and scope of this study.\n\n# Visualizations\n<div class=\"img-box\">\n<a href=\"https://hristog.github.io/uploads/Friends_num_lines_all.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hristog.github.io/uploads/Friends_num_lines_all_120x206.png\" alt=\"Number of lines for all characters\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://hristog.github.io/uploads/Friends_num_lines_all_s5on.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hristog.github.io/uploads/Friends_num_lines_all_s5on_120x206.png\" alt=\"Number of lines for all characters\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://hristog.github.io/uploads/Friends_num_lines_supp.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hristog.github.io/uploads/Friends_num_lines_supp_120x206.png\" alt=\"Number of lines with focus on supporting characters\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://hristog.github.io/uploads/Friends_line_length_all.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hristog.github.io/uploads/Friends_line_length_all_120x206.png\" alt=\"Total line length for all characters\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://hristog.github.io/uploads/Friends_line_length_supp.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hristog.github.io/uploads/Friends_line_length_supp_120x206.png\" alt=\"Total line length with focus on supporting characters\"></a>\n</div>\n\nWe can clearly observe well formed pairs of characters[^char_pairs] by as early as\nthe end of fourth season: Ross and Rachel, Monica and Chandler, and Joey and Phoebe.\n\nSince the [beginning of the fifth season][s05_start], however, when a significant\nevent takes place in the personal life of one of the leading cast members, we see a\ndramatic reshuffling of the \"leaderboard\".
