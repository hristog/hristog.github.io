Fantasy football managers usually enhance the selection process by following news outlets, and by performing statistical analyses of various degrees of complexity.\n\n## The Fantasy Premier League\nThere's an entire [section][fepl_section] on this blog, dedicated to the [Fantasy Premier League][fepl_site], and predominantly targeting the portion of fantasy managers, who are interested in supplementing their knowledge and insights by delving into statistically-supported articles.\n\nIn a series of posts, I'll attempt to help you improve your selection, or even create an initial one, based on statistical analysis or relatively simple heuristics. If you haven't created an account yet, it's probably a good idea to head over to the Fantasy Premier League's registration [page][fepl_register] and become a fantasy manager before the official start of the [season][epl_fixtures] (which is in the second week of August).\n\n# Fantasy Season 2017/2018\n## Player Selection\nThe game organizers have conveniently provided a printable single-page [reference][fepl_player_list] to the last season's performance (in terms of total number of points only, however) of the footballers which comprise the current transfer pool. One of the next posts, in my Fantasy Football [series][fepl_section], is specifically concerned with scraping and parsing that list, and proposes an algorithm for finding optimal selections, using the minimal information provided as a starting point.\n\nThis post, however, will focus on a bit deeper and more interesting look at last season's total points - we'll see how each one of the top 50 players ranks relative to his team-mates, as well as players from opponent teams. In other words, this study will provide insights into a player's degree of contribution, with respect to the same positional line [^fepl_positions], as well as the entire squad.\n\n[^fepl_positions]: In the Fantasy Premier League game, all players are divided into 4 categories of positions, which are fixed for the entire course of the season. Every player\ncan be assigned only one position from the following list: goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and forward.\n\n## Visualizations\n<div class=\"img-box\">\n<a href=\"/uploads/fepl_tp_contributions/fepl_tp_contribution_2016_overall.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/uploads/fepl_tp_contributions/fepl_tp_contribution_2016_overall_170x256.png\" alt=\"Total Points (FEPL 2016/2017, whole season)\"></a>\n<a href=\"/uploads/fepl_tp_contributions/fepl_tp_contribution_2016_1h.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/uploads/fepl_tp_contributions/fepl_tp_contribution_2016_1h_170x256.png\" alt=\"Total Points (FEPL 2016/2017, first half of season)\"></a>\n<a href=\"/uploads/fepl_tp_contributions/fepl_tp_contribution_2016_2h.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/uploads/fepl_tp_contributions/fepl_tp_contribution_2016_2h_170x256.png\" alt=\"Total Points (FEPL 2016/2017, second half of season)\"></a>\n<a href=\"/uploads/fepl_tp_contributions/fepl_tp_contribution_pct_2016_overall.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/uploads/fepl_tp_contributions/fepl_tp_contribution_pct_2016_overall_172x256.png\" alt=\"Contribution to Team Total Points (FEPL 2016/2017, whole season)\"></a>\n<a href=\"/uploads/fepl_tp_contributions/fepl_tp_contribution_pct_2016_1h.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/uploads/fepl_tp_contributions/fepl_tp_contribution_pct_2016_1h_172x256.png\" alt=\"Contribution to Team Total Points (FEPL 2016/2017, first half of season)\"></a>\n<a href=\"/uploads/fepl_tp_contributions/fepl_tp_contribution_pct_2016_2h.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/uploads/fepl_tp_contributions/fepl_tp_contribution_pct_2016_2h_172x256.png\" alt=\"Contribution to Team Total Points (FEPL 2016/2017, second half of season)\"></a>\n</div>\n\n<!--\n- Explanation of position abbrevs\n- Explanation that int he 2nd set of plots, the percentages are relative to the total squad points.\n\n- Lukaku vs H.
