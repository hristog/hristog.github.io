Alternatively, you may still proceed at your own caution - might save you some troubles down the line :)\n\nNow `git` believes that `HEAD` doesn't exist and your current branch has no commits, but stages all files that were associated with the branch as new files. Wunderbah[^wunderbah]! Just wunderbah! How do you get out of that Houdini?!? Can you reset to `HEAD` or `HEAD^`. Nein! Further - as if it's not a big enough fun already - depending on how different your branch was to any other, it may not let you checkout anything else.\n\nOkay, time for solutions! You could opt for performing `git rm -f` on everything that had been staged. At that point, an actual branch can be checked out again. Alternatively, invoking `git reflog` followed by `git checkout` of the commit hash of the head of the old branch should do the job.\nIf you want to play fancy, you can re-create the branch, make a commit, checkout another branch, and delete the originally intended branch.\n\nThat's about it! Have lots of fun in `git`land and see you soon!\n\n[^wunderbah]: For the non-German speaking among you, _wunderbah_ means _wonderful_.",
