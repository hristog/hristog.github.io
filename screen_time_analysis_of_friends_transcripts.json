It consists, namely, of\ntranscripts of all episodes from all seasons of one of my favorite TV series,\n[Friends][friends_wiki].\n\n![Friends TV Series](/uploads/friends_logo.png \"Friends TV Series\")\n\n# Dataset\nThe aforementioned dataset, consists of transcripts, spread across\na nested structure of seasons[^s2_formatting], episodes, and scenes. Each scene, naturally,\ncontains a sequence of lines, by characters predominantly addressing each\nother. For examples, here's a simplified example of a scene:\n```text\n[Scene: A Park, Alice and Bob are having a picnic.]\nAlice: We're quite lucky with the weather today, aren't we?\nBob: Indeed, we are.\n```\n\n[^s2_formatting]: Due to poorly-formatted raw data for the second season, for the\npurposes of this study the corresponding episodes were excluded from the analysis.\nNevertheless, I plan to customize my script further, in order to be able to subsequently include the missing data.\n\n# Methodology\nThe focus of this study is to investigate two proxies of character importances,\nnamely, total number of lines alloted, and sum of the lengths[^line_length] of\nall lines alloted, for each individual season.\n\n[^line_length]: While, line length can be viewed as a form of a proxy for total\namount of screen time alloted to a given character, please, note that in this\nstudy the actual temporal dimension was not considered in any way whatsoever.\nFor completeness, line length is defined as the total number of characters -\nincluding punctuation (which is assumed to account for additional screen time) -\ncomprising a given character line. And line, itself, is defined as a contiguous\narray of sentences, alloted to a a set of characters (usually, a single\ncharacter).\n\nOf course, given the raw nature of the unprocessed data, the aforementioned metrics\nare only approximations. Nevertheless their degree of significance is strong enough\nfor the purposes and scope of this study.\n\n# Visualizations\n<div class=\"img-box\">\n<a href=\"/uploads/Friends_num_lines_all.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/uploads/Friends_num_lines_all_150x256.png\" alt=\"Number of lines for all characters\"></a>\n<a href=\"/uploads/Friends_num_lines_all_s5on.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/uploads/Friends_num_lines_all_s5on_144x256.png\" alt=\"Number of lines for all characters\"></a>\n<a href=\"/uploads/Friends_num_lines_supp.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/uploads/Friends_num_lines_supp_148x256.png\" alt=\"Number of lines with focus on supporting characters\"></a>\n<a href=\"/uploads/Friends_line_length_all.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/uploads/Friends_line_length_all_150x256.png\" alt=\"Total line length for all characters\"></a>\n<a href=\"/uploads/Friends_line_length_supp.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/uploads/Friends_line_length_supp_148x256.png\" alt=\"Total line length with focus on supporting characters\"></a>\n</div>\n\nWe can clearly observe well-formed[^pair_formation] pairs of characters[^char_pairs], by as early as the end of the fourth season: [Ross and Rachel][ross_rachel], [Monica and Chandler][monica_chandler], and [Joey][joey] and [Phoebe][phoebe]; the total line length graphs reveal a further pair, formed by [Joey and Chandler][joey_chandler][^jman_channie], which is not clear enough given only the context of the screen-time\nanalysis, though.\n\nSince the [beginning of the fifth season][s05_start], however, when a significant\nevent takes place in the personal life of one of the leading cast members, we see a\ndramatic reshuffling of the \"leaderboard\". In particular, the beginning of the\nseason in question, approximately overlaps with the beginning of Jennifer Aniston's [relationship][ja_relationships] with Brad Pitt[^will_colbert], eventually leading to their marriage, immediately after the [end of season six][s06_end] (around halfway through 2000).\n\nTo put it mildly, as a result[^ja_correlation], the total amount of screen time[^screen_time_proxies]\nalloted to Aniston's character, Rachel, skyrockets for seasons 7 and 8.\n\nAnother dramatic anomaly observed in the graphs is the significantly reduced\nseason eight screen time, alloted to Chandler (portrayed by the wonderful Matthew Perry). A quick reference check on [what was going on][matthew_perry] in the actor's life around that time, reveals that he had been battling with opioid\naddiction (and, reportedly, entered rehab near the end of the\n[seventh season][s07_end]).\n\n[^pair_formation]: The notion of a pair here, however, is relatively vague, given\nthe quintessentially fluent nature of interactions taking place within the context\nof a sitcom environment.\n[^char_pairs]: Of course, this is by no means an estimate of amount of intra-pair interaction between said characters. It should be thought of more as a sort of ranking, based on character importance or reputation, corresponding the particular period of\nthe timeline of the TV series.\n[^jman_channie]: At this point, the average die-hard fan of the show is probably reminded of quintessential moments like Joey's _\"No more J-man and Channie's\"_\n[line][jman_channie], after Chandler informed Joey he'd been moving out to live together with Monica.\n[^will_colbert]: Traditionally, just as the other various celebrities who were\n[partners of cast members][friends_relationships] at one point or another, Brad Pitt eventually [made an appearance][bradpitt_cast] on the show,\nportraying Will Colbert, who was presented as a former high school mate of Ross, Monica and Rachel.\n[^ja_correlation]: Naturally, this is only a correlation outlined by the data.\nThis study does not mean or intend, in any way whatsoever, to underestimate\nJennifer Aniston's acting skills or visual characteristics (or any other factor\nthat might have contributed to her amazing success, for that matter).\n[^screen_time_proxies]: As estimated via the total number of lines, as well as\nthe cousin statistic, total line length.\n\n# Source code\nThe plan is to eventually release my [Jupyter Notebook][jupyter_notebook] and source code (once I bring them to a neat enough implementation state), used for performing the\nanalysis, on [GitHub][github_account], write an accompanying blog post here to\nsupport the various implementation-design decisions, and provide minimally sufficient background for the employed technologies.\n\n[friends_wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends\n[got_vis_reddit]: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/6n150e/oc_screen_time_of_got_characters_fixed/\n[ja_relationships]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston#Relationships\n[matthew_perry]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Perry#Personal_life\n[joey_chandler]: http://friends.wikia.com/wiki/Chandler_and_Joey%27s_apartment\n[joey]: http://friends.wikia.com/wiki/Joey_Tribbiani_Jr.\n[phoebe]: http://friends.wikia.com/wiki/Phoebe_Buffay\n[monica_chandler]: http://friends.wikia.com/wiki/Monica_and_Chandler\n[ross_rachel]: http://friends.wikia.com/wiki/Ross_and_Rachel\n[friends_relationships]: http://friends.wikia.com/wiki/Relationships\n[jman_channie]: http://friends.wikia.com/wiki/The_One_Where_Ross_Hugs_Rachel\n[s05_start]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Friends_episodes#Season_5_.281999.E2.80.9300.29\n[s06_end]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Friends_episodes#Season_6_.281999.E2.80.9300.29\n[s07_end]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Friends_episodes#Season_7_.282000.E2.80.9301.29\n[bradpitt_cast]: http://friends.wikia.com/wiki/The_One_With_The_Rumor\n[jupyter_notebook]: https://jupyter.org/\n[github_account]: https://github.com/hristog\n",

It should be thought of more as a sort of ranking, based on character importance or reputation, corresponding the particular period of\nthe timeline of the TV series.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://hristog.github.io/screen_time_analysis_of_friends_transcripts.html#fnref:char_pairs\" rev=\"footnote\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 4 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:jman_channie\">\n<p>At this point, the average die-hard fan of the show is probably reminded of quintessential moments like Joey's <em>\"No more J-man and Channie's\"</em>\n<a href=\"http://friends.wikia.com/wiki/The_One_Where_Ross_Hugs_Rachel\">line</a>, after Chandler informed Joey he'd been moving out to live together with Monica.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://hristog.github.io/screen_time_analysis_of_friends_transcripts.html#fnref:jman_channie\" rev=\"footnote\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 5 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:will_colbert\">\n<p>Traditionally, just as the other various celebrities who were\n<a href=\"http://friends.wikia.com/wiki/Relationships\">partners of cast members</a> at one point or another, Brad Pitt eventually <a href=\"http://friends.wikia.com/wiki/The_One_With_The_Rumor\">made an appearance</a> on the show,\nportraying Will Colbert, who was presented as a former high school mate of Ross, Monica and Rachel.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://hristog.github.io/screen_time_analysis_of_friends_transcripts.html#fnref:will_colbert\" rev=\"footnote\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 6 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:ja_correlation\">\n<p>Naturally, this is only a correlation outlined by the data.\nThis study does not mean or intend, in any way whatsoever, to underestimate\nJennifer Aniston's acting skills or visual characteristics (or any other factor\nthat might have contributed to her amazing success, for that matter).&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://hristog.github.io/screen_time_analysis_of_friends_transcripts.html#fnref:ja_correlation\" rev=\"footnote\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 7 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:screen_time_proxies\">\n<p>As estimated via the total number of lines, as well as\nthe cousin statistic, total line length.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://hristog.github.io/screen_time_analysis_of_friends_transcripts.html#fnref:screen_time_proxies\" rev=\"footnote\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 8 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
