# Conscious Automaton

This is the source code and static content of my blog _"Conscious Automaton"_, where
(as per its subtitle, `from hristog.thoughts import random`) readers can sample serialized items from
the bizarrely random distribution of thought processes going on in my head.

Predominantly, blog-post topics will mostly span across the areas of programming,
data science, analysis and visualization.
