# Overview

Welcome to my blog, regardless of how randomly you've arrived here! Also, this web space
doesn't discriminate between human beings and search-engine robots[^google_bot], so congrats for
having joined the party (intendedly or not ;) )!

[^google_bot]: Yes, I'm pointing at you, `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)`!

Apparently, emulating human unintelligence in AI is becoming one of the most important 21st century features, among those ones which haven't been given enough consideration. Just some food for thought ...

Given the above, dear reader, you're now officially entitled for sampling serialized items
from the bizarrely random distribution of thought processes going on in my head.
Please, find an excerpt from the very source code powering said thought processes:
```python
# Found somewhere in the ` __init__` method.
self.add_tag("#PerpetualStudentOfLife")
self.add_passions({'Data Science', 'AI', 'football'})

# Further down in the main event loop.
if self.alive():
    yesterday = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=1)
    self.improve(directions={Criterion.BETTER, Criterion.SMARTER},
                 baseline=yesterday)
```

As it can be easily inferred at this point, the predominant nature of blog-post topics will span across the areas of programming, data science, analysis and visualization - sometimes seasoned with a bit of [football][football][^soccer] flavour[^football_skills].

Feel free to visit my GitHub [profile][github] for a sample of my programming mastery (or "mastery" ;)). Alternatively, you can view a [list][github_prs] of literally all GitHub pull requests of mine, that have ever been made. I'm an avid reader and podcast listener, and I've recently put together a list of all [#Python][python], Machine Learning and [#DataScience][data_science]-related [podcasts][podcasts] that I follow on a daily basis. A similar list of books might follow.

[^soccer]: I'm referring to the European variety, a.k.a. soccer.

[^football_skills]: For the curious among yourselves, I've recorded a sample of a little kickabout
of mine with a mini-football. [Enjoy][football_video] :)

# The definition of t<sub>0</sub>
It all started when I was 7 or 8 years old. It couldn't be distinguished from any other visit to my aunt's flat, yet nevertheless that particular one turned out to change my life. Forever.

I found myself leafing through a random book on the BASIC programming language, intended for
beginners. For the life of me, I can't remember it's title, but
it was one of those typical BASIC books, where you're presented with a bunch of programs, spread
over several pages, and if you'd want to interact in a bit more engaging way with them, you'd had to
laboriously type up the code, character by character (and, yes - in the case of BASIC - line number
by line number).

A peculiar characteristic of that book was the it was greatly illustrated, and the bugs in the
programs were represented as cartoons of computerised bugs. I couldn't stop devouring the pages, one
after another - everything just clicked[^basic_for_beginners].

That marked the beginning of my love affair with abstract representations, skyscrapers built upon
layers of logic and the alluring notion of attempting to create artificial intelligence[^artificial_intelligence].

[^basic_for_beginners]: Wait a minute, I never said it was a book on programming nuclear physics
simulations with BASIC! It was your typical introductory book a-la "Here's how you do loops, and
this is how you do conditional statements".

[^artificial_intelligence]: I'm pretty sure I was not familiar of the exact term back then (to be fair, even nowadays, there doesn't seem to be a generally agreed-upon definition that best captures the notion yet), but I tended to daydream about building robots, and eventually my passion converged
on focusing with their "brains".
