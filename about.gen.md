Welcome to my blog, regardless of how randomly you've arrived here! Also, this web space
doesn't discriminate between human beings and search-engine robots[^google_bot], so congrats for
having joined the party (intendedly or not ;) )!

[^google_bot]: Yes, I'm pointing at you, `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)`!
You were caught only because your [reCAPTCHA][recaptcha] score was completely off the charts.
Apparently, emulating human unintelligence in AI is becoming one of the most important 21st century features, among those ones which haven't been given enough consideration. Just some food for thought ...

Given the above, dear reader, you're now officially entitled for sampling serialized items
from the bizarrely random distribution of thought processes going on in my head.
Please, find an excerpt from the very source code powering said thought processes:
```python
# Found somewhere in the ` __init__` method.
self.add_tag("#PerpetualStudentOfLife")
self.add_passions({'Data Science', 'AI', 'football'})

# Further down in the main event loop.
if self.alive():
    yesterday = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=1)
    self.improve(directions={Criterion.BETTER, Criterion.SMARTER},
                 baseline=yesterday)
```

As it can be easily inferred at this point, the predominant nature of blog-post topics will span across the areas of programming, data science, analysis and visualization - sometimes seasoned with a bit of [football][football][^soccer] flavour[^football_skills].

Feel free to visit my GitHub [profile][github] for a sample of my programming mastery (or "mastery" ;)). Alternatively, you can view a [list][github_prs] of literally all GitHub pull requests of mine, that have ever been made. I'm an avid reader and podcast listener, and I've recently put together a list of all Python, Machine Learning and [#DataScience][data_science]-related [podcasts][podcasts] that I follow on a daily basis. A similar list of books might follow.

[^soccer]: I'm referring to the European variety, a.k.a. soccer.

[^football_skills]: For the curious among yourselves, I've recorded a sample of a little kickabout
of mine with a mini-football. [Enjoy][football_video] :)
