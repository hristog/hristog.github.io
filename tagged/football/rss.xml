&lt;p&gt;This post is part of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fantasy-football&quot;&gt;Fantasy Football&lt;/a&gt; team selection &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fpl-selection&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, where - as alluded previously - I aim to assist you in the best possible way in making your 2017/2018 picks, at pre-season time, as well as once the season has been kicked off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html&quot;&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt; our focus was on investigating how each player - among those ones who finished at the first 50 positions, ranked by highest overall points scored - contributed to the total points count of his team and, furthermore, his playing line within the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post, however, is more concerned with the actual playing characteristics of the leading&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:by_total_points&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fn:by_total_points&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; players, as observed in their overall statistics for the English Premier League 2016/2017 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;contribution_to_team_play&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#contribution_to_team_play&quot;&gt;Contribution to Team Play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Particularly, we'll look at various attacking and defensive statistics&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:scored_goals_excluded&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fn:scored_goals_excluded&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of top players from different lines. In order to keep the analyses clean and uncluttered, I've decided to split the visualizations and commentary on playing line basis. We'll start by looking at the forwards, who have netted 150 points or more last season. They turn out to be 7 in total:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Romelu Lukaku (221 points, avg. value £9.74)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Harry Kane (220 points, avg. value £11.13)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Diego Da Silva Costa (196 points, avg. value £10.38)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Sergio Agüero (175 points, avg. value £12.88)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Jermain Defoe (166 points, avg. value £7.54)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Zlatan Ibrahimovic (163 points, avg. value £11.44)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Jamie Vardy (161 points, avg. value £9.76)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;visualisations&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#visualisations&quot;&gt;Visualisations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/uploads/fepl_play_contributions/Zlatan_Ibrahimovic.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/uploads/fepl_play_contributions/Zlatan_Ibrahimovic_250x256.png&quot; alt=&quot;Zlatan Ibrahimovic (163 points, avg. value £11.44)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/uploads/fepl_play_contributions/Jamie_Vardy.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/uploads/fepl_play_contributions/Jamie_Vardy_250x256.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jamie Vardy (161 points, avg. value £9.76)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, as in the entire &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fpl-selection&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, I've chosen to put forth, with utmost importance, self-explanatory plots, requiring the minimum amount of supplementary explanations that are only related to various technicalities, which cannot be explained solely by employing visual cues. Examples of such are characteristics of the given population sample, or of the scale axes etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As enlisted above, the play contribution plots are captioned, naturally, with the player name, along with the
total amount of points scored for the corresponding season, as well as the average transfer cost of that player (averaged over the cost of that player, corresponding to each individual gameweek). It is important to note here that the scale ranges/limits are fixed for all plots, for the purpose of enabling comparability between individual players. The maximum value along each scale is the greatest value that has been observed among &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; the seven forwards on focus (as the idea of the study is to find indicative characteristics, in a relative fashion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll briefly go over some significant observations, based on the graphs presented above, whilst leaving the conclusions, as well as transfer and selection decisions, as an exercise, entirely for you. Firstly, we can see that the most creative forwards are Costa, Lukaku and Ibrahimovic, with Kane following somehow closely in pursuit. In defensive plan, noteworthy mentions are Kane, Costa and Defoe, along with Ibrahimovic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the not so positive &quot;contributions&quot;, some sort of an indication (or validation in Agüero's case) can be inferred, regarding a player's injury proneness or lower capabilities for recovery from fatigue. Namely, Kane's, Agüero's, Ibrahimovic's and Vardy's performances are characterised by the lowest number of minutes played. This, in Kane's case automatically grants him the award of highest conversion efficiency, as he's the top goalscorer of last season, and a runner-up in the total points ranking, for his playing line (losing by just a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; point, to Romelu Lukaku, who played 831 minutes more than Kane did; this is 9.25 games!). This, essentially, reinforces the self-referential nature of this post by serving as a reminder that a player's output - in terms of goals, total points scored or otherwise - is largely a function of the collective contributions&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:playing_line_contributions&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fn:playing_line_contributions&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of those team-mates (whose output is also result of the same recursive process), who were part of the ten playing field players, at any given time, as well as the team synergy level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the spectrum, Jermaine Defoe, aged 34, spent the mind-bending 3322 playing minutes on the field, which when converted to number of games adds up to almost 37 games!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for today, folks! Good luck in the forthcoming Fantasy Premier League season, and stay tuned for more analysis and visualisations on the same topic. It may be a good idea to follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hristogeo&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, if you haven't done so already ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:by_total_points&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I maintain the opinion that the most useful analyses are those which invariably incorporate the notion of player output, as expressed in Fantasy Football terms, namely points scored (as this is the ultimate metric, based on which, all teams are ranked in the league standings, be it final or intermediate). Thus, it's always useful to reflect and, if possible, present a form of correlation analysis (or display) between the total points, possibly accompanied with its sister metric - player transfer value (or cost), and whatever discriminative features or statistics are utilised for analysing a subset of players. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 1 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:by_total_points&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:scored_goals_excluded&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, note that I've deliberately excluded the total number of goals scored, which by itself can be a misleading statistic, as it doesn't clearly indicate whether the goals in question were scored predominantly as a result of a player's attacking positioning, his finishing skill, his teammates' creativity or otherwise. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 2 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:scored_goals_excluded&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:interceptions&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;interceptions&lt;/em&gt; metric has been particularly defined to include the total number of clearances, blocks and interceptions, for a given player. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 3 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:interceptions&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:playing_line_contributions&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be further verified via referring to the study of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html&quot;&gt;total points contributions&lt;/a&gt;, which pays an honourable mention to the Tottenham midfield line, who were the highest scoring midfield line for FPL season 2016/2017, in terms of total number of points scored. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 4 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:playing_line_contributions&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;fantasy_football&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#fantasy_football&quot;&gt;Fantasy Football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the_underlying_idea&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#the_underlying_idea&quot;&gt;The Underlying Idea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_(Association)&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fantasy Football [is] a game in which participants assemble an imaginary team of real life footballers and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance or their perceived contribution on the field of play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, football aficionados make selections - subject to a pre-defined set of constraints (e.g., maximum number of players per team etc.) - which are a form of encoded predictions of how well a subset of the entire player pool will perform. Fantasy football managers usually enhance the selection process by following news outlets, and by performing statistical analyses of various degrees of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the_fantasy_premier_league&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#the_fantasy_premier_league&quot;&gt;The Fantasy Premier League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an entire &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fantasy-football&quot;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; on this blog, dedicated to analysis of fantasy football competitions, and predominantly targeting the portion of fantasy managers, who are interested in supplementing their knowledge and insights by delving into statistically-supported articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fpl-selection&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of posts, focused on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fantasy.premierleague.com/&quot;&gt;Fantasy Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, I'll attempt to assist you in improving selection (or verifying that it's already perfectly-polished!), or even create an initial one, based on statistical analysis or relatively simple heuristics. If you haven't created an account yet, it's probably a good idea to head over to the Fantasy Premier League's registration &lt;a href=&quot;https://users.premierleague.com/a/profile/register&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; and become a fantasy manager before the official start of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.premierleague.com/fixtures&quot;&gt;season&lt;/a&gt; (which is in the second week of August).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fantasy_season_2017_2018&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#fantasy_season_2017_2018&quot;&gt;Fantasy Season 2017/2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;player_selection&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#player_selection&quot;&gt;Player Selection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game organizers have conveniently provided a printable single-page &lt;a href=&quot;https://fantasy.premierleague.com/player-list/&quot;&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt; to the last season's performance (in terms of total number of points only, however) of the footballers which comprise the current transfer pool. One of the next posts, in my Fantasy Football &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fpl-selection&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, is specifically concerned with scraping and parsing that list, and proposes an algorithm for finding optimal selections, using the minimal information provided as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post, however, will focus on a bit deeper and more interesting look at last season's total points - we'll see how each one of the top 50 players ranks relative to his team-mates, as well as players from opponent teams. In other words, this study will provide insights into a player's degree of contribution, with respect to the same positional line &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fepl_positions&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#fn:fepl_positions&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as the entire squad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphs presented here contain information regarding overall contributions, in terms of total number of points&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fepl_points&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#fn:fepl_points&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The contributions are colour-coded, depending on  whether they represent player-only, line-only (i.e., the total point score of all goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders or forwards in a given team) or total team contributions. Particularly, the top 50, high-scoring, players are considered, and - in all graphs - the ordering of players is fixed, so that the highest scoring one is at the top, and the lowest scoring one - at the bottom, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Essentially, there are two sets of visualizations:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;absolute total number of points scored for each of the top 50 highest scoring players, their corresponding line, and their team total;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;relative number of points (in terms of percentage) that each player contributed to his playing line, along with the contribution of that line to the team total.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of providing some sort of a temporal dimension, and a better idea as to how each individual player, line and team ranked as time went by, each of the two sets of plots is further subdivided into three categories (each alloted a dedicated bar chart): contribution across the entire 2016/2017 season, and in each half, separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this context, the graphs become more or less self-explanatory, enabling one to draw straightforward conclusions. We can clearly see the total domination of Sánchez (264 points), who was the winner of the season, with a remarkable performance in the midfield line of Arsenal, while neither of the latter were on the top 2 positions in their corresponding rankings (the respective scores were 1044 and 2015 points, for the Arsenal midfield line, and the team overall). The runner-up, Hazard (224 points), also demonstrated significant contribution in Chelsea's midfield line (952 points), which itself didn't rank nearly as high as those of Liverpool (1214 points) and Manchester City (1153 points).
While this study is not focused on player transfer values, it is imperative to point your attention towards Swansea's Sigurdsson, whose average value was only £7.42. Nevertheless, he managed to contribute by a rate higher than that of Sánchez to his corresponding midfield line, and managed to net 181 points in total - for reference, that was only 15 less
than Diego Costa from Chelsea. However, the average total value of the latter was £10.42, while that of Arsenal's Alexis Sánchez was even higher - £11.51.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along an analogous chain of reasoning, we see a clear justification for Lukaku's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40550934&quot;&gt;£75m transfer&lt;/a&gt; to Manchester United this summer. The forward finished at the top in his playing line (221 points), and his contributions were greater in proportion - 12.5% vs. 10% and 16.3% vs. 12.5% - relative to his runner-up, Harry Kane (220 points).
The latter, team-based comparison provides indication of Lukaku's significant contribution, from within a context of lower degree of support from his team-mates, as reflected in Everton's total points, 1771, in contrast to the 2194 scored by all Tottenham players, making them the winning team of the last season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these are just a few examples of head-to-head analysis, intended to supplement your selection-making strategy. As mentioned above, the plots themselves speak much more than a thousand words, by themselves only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this post has managed to deepen your insights into last season's top player performance, in terms of total number of points scored. For this purpose, I presented a multi-dimensional view, providing information as to how a given player ranked, on the overall, relative to teammates with the most similar tasks and responsibilities&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:football_strategy&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#fn:football_strategy&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as competing players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In further posts from the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fpl-selection&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, we'll look into various other statistics and metrics, accompanied by descriptive visualizations, for the very same
purpose stated above - assisting you, the reader, in making the best possible selection for the next game-week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn:fepl_positions&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Fantasy Premier League game, all players are divided into 4 categories of positions, which are fixed for the entire course of the season. Every player
can be assigned only one position from the following list: goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and forward. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 1 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:fepl_positions&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:fepl_points&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://fantasy.premierleague.com/help/&quot;&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt; on point scoring, navigate to the &lt;em&gt;Rules&lt;/em&gt; tab, and then the &lt;em&gt;Scoring&lt;/em&gt; section. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 2 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:fepl_points&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:football_strategy&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, whilst providing statistically-backed informational value, this statement is a wild over-generalization, when we consider the
elaborate nature of modern football strategies and formations, where individual instructions and tasks vary both along temporal, intra- as well as inter-match, scales. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 3 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:football_strategy&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
