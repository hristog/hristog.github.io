&lt;p&gt;It's time for the concluding post from the team-player contribution &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/team-play-contributions&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; on the defense line. I've opted to not write one on goalkeepers, not because I don't consider that particular position to be as valuable as the others. On the contrary, I am a big proponent of the saying that a good goalkeeper is makes up half a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, neither have I unlimited time for writing this blog, nor your time - as readers - is unlimited. Football is a game where goals are the ultimate determinant at the end of the day, and regardless of whether you're a beginner fantasy manager or a seasoned one, it's not a secret to you that attacking players tend to score a significantly larger amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html&quot;&gt;points&lt;/a&gt; than the defensive ones, especially goalkeepers. Thus, my decision to not allot precious air time on them in this particular analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off we go to the pretty radar plots I've compiled for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for tagging along for this one, too! Now that the kick-off of the FPL 2017/2018 season is steadily approaching, there's not much left here to say, but to wish all of you good luck. May the best fantasy manager lift the trophy at the end of gameweek 38! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, almost forgot - for those of you who are particularly hungry for more data-analysis- or visualisation-related content, feel free to check out my Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hristogeo&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; which has been kept relatively fresh, with a few (re-)tweets per week.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is a continuation of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fantasy-football&quot;&gt;Fantasy Football&lt;/a&gt; team-player contribution &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/team-play-contributions&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;. Don't worry too much if you've missed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html&quot;&gt;previous one&lt;/a&gt; about the analysis of the top forwards of 2016/2017 - it is by no means a prerequisite to the current and next posts, which cover the midfield and defensive line, in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, without further ado, let's look at the top midfielders which managed to score 150 points or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess there's no better time to call it a day and let you rush over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fantasy.premierleague.com/a/squad/transfers&quot;&gt;transfers&lt;/a&gt; section of the Fantasy Premier League website and ponder about your &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fpl-selection&quot;&gt;picks&lt;/a&gt;. However, you might want to follow along with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/team-play-contributions&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; before forming your ultimate conclusions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;energy_conversion_efficiency&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/playing_time_conversion_efficiency_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#energy_conversion_efficiency&quot;&gt;Energy conversion efficiency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy conversion efficiency (&lt;em&gt;η&lt;/em&gt;) is the ratio between the useful output of an energy conversion machine and the input, in energy terms. The input, as well as the useful output may be electric power, mechanical work, light (radiation), or heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another post from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fantasy-football&quot;&gt;Fantasy Football&lt;/a&gt; team selection &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fpl-selection&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;. Today, we're going to view football players as playing-time &quot;conversion machines&quot;, and thus aim to draw a suitable parallel to the &lt;em&gt;energy conversion efficiency&lt;/em&gt; metric, for the purpose of gathering a different dimension of insights about the Fantasy Premier League transfer market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;playing_time&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/playing_time_conversion_efficiency_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#playing_time&quot;&gt;Playing time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly, for completion of the analogy, and actually for enabling our analysis to provide meaningful conclusions, we'll imagine - within the context of this post only - that football players are machines
that convert playing minutes into fantasy football points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the average number of points per match&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:playing_only&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/playing_time_conversion_efficiency_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fn:playing_only&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; an FPL player scored in 2016/2017 was only 2.97, our ratio of interest will be &lt;em&gt;average number of points scored per 90 minutes&lt;/em&gt; (which is the duration of the regular time of all English Premier League matches). This means that we'll be looking for players who were able to take as many as possible playing minutes as input, and produce as many as possible points as output, namely footballers with high &lt;em&gt;playing time conversion efficiency&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a gotcha involved, of course, and - as you may have guessed already - assuming the aforementioned ratio to be the only criterion employed, when drawing conclusions regarding playing efficiency, would be an utter failure at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider, for instance, an imaginary footballer who scores two goals in the first game of the season, then gets an injury which prevents him from playing a full-match for 10 weeks, then scores a goal and makes an assist in his second match of the season, then gets injured again, until the very last match of the season, when he comes in for about 35 minutes, as a substitute - no goals, no assist this time. What do you think? Would it have been reasonable, in hindsight, to have purchased this player in the beginning of the season and to have kept him in your squad until the very end of the season, without having transferred him out. I believe your answer is No, and it should be - despite the high &lt;em&gt;playing time conversion efficiency&lt;/em&gt; ratio he managed to squeeze out. Perhaps, he's an extremely skilled footballer, but we have to keep in mind his injury proneness as well, as I alluded to in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html&quot;&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt; of my team-play contributions &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/team-play-contributions&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;. The number of playing minutes can usually be the best obtainable proxy, as all datasets, involving physiological player data, are strictly proprietary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, as an outlier detection method, we'll employ the following simple heuristic: we'll filter out all players,
who participated in less than a pre-defined portion of all matches of their team; I've opted for 75%&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:participation_threshold&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/playing_time_conversion_efficiency_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fn:participation_threshold&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,
which seems to be a reasonable enough figure&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fa_participation_requirement&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/playing_time_conversion_efficiency_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fn:fa_participation_requirement&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This, basically, means that we'll be only focusing on players who took part in at least 29 Premier League games during the 2016/2017 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;visualisation&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/playing_time_conversion_efficiency_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#visualisation&quot;&gt;Visualisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/uploads/fepl_playing_time_conversion_efficiency/Playing_time_converstion_efficiency.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hristog.github.iouploads/fepl_playing_time_conversion_efficiency/Playing_time_converstion_efficiency_230x256.png&quot; alt=&quot;Playing Time Conversion Efficiency (FPL Season 2016/2017)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we've got one graph only - nevertheless, it's fully-packed with useful information (that's why it doesn't need any companions). Firstly, we've got a bunch of points on the 2-D plane - each one of them
corresponds to a player, who played in at least 29 English Premier League matches in 2016/2017&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fpl_only&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/playing_time_conversion_efficiency_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fn:fpl_only&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;-axis, there is the total points count for each of the players, and along the &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;-axis - the average number of points scored per 90 mins (that is, essentially, our &lt;em&gt;playing time conversion efficiency&lt;/em&gt; ratio), both of which will serve, visually, for comparative purposes. A further dimension that has been depicted is the average player value, encoded as the area&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:circle_area&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/playing_time_conversion_efficiency_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fn:circle_area&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (or size, in layman terms) of the corresponding circle. Thus, the total points and conversion efficiency readings, should be taken based on the centre of a player's circle. I've further annotated the most important quadrant - the upper right one, where we have the highest total points totals and the highest time conversion ratio - with the footballer names, for clarity (although, to be fair, this wasn't really necessary for Agüero or Sánchez, due to the enormous transfer value of the former, and the top rank - in total points terms - of the latter). Last but not least, I've colour-coded the footballer circles based on their playing line, in order to be
able to visually distinguish patterns, related to individual lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few quick observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No goalkeeper has managed to score more than 150 points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average transfer values of goalkeepers and defenders are lowest, whilst midfielders cost higher on average, and forwards cost even higher. This is not that surprising, given the fact that the playing lines of the highest-point-scoring footballers are exactly the latter two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the leadership of the forwards - in the value ranking - we can clearly see that, in terms of scoring fantasy football points, the best-performing midfielders are at least as good, and as efficient, as the best-performing forwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as an example of the usefulness of the graph, let's consider the following players, for the purpose of performing some straightforward head-to-head comparisons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gary Cahill (DEF)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marcos Alonso (DEF)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gylfi Sigurdsson (MID)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joshua King (MID)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bamidele Alli (MID)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roberto Firmino (MID)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diego Da Silva Costa (FWD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romelu Lukaku (FWD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that one would have been better off with a combination of King and Cahill, instead of Alonso and Sigurdsson. Further, Alli ranks much better - whilst characterised by similar average value - than Firmino, and one would have had a more successful selection, if it had included Lukaku, at the expense of Costa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/playing_time_conversion_efficiency_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This marks the end of the current analysis, concerned with playing time conversion efficiency. If you

Ciao until &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fpl-selection&quot;&gt;next time&lt;/a&gt; ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:playing_only&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statistic, naturally, considers only those matches in which a player participated for at least a single minute. Averaging over playing and non-playing &quot;participations&quot; brings us down to an 1.31 average points scored per match, across the entire last season. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 1 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/playing_time_conversion_efficiency_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:playing_only&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:participation_threshold&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The straightforward maths goes as follows: 75% x 38 = 28.5, and to be on the strict side, I've taken the ceiling of that number, namely 29, to be the minimum requirement for a number of matches played, in order to be included into our analysis. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 2 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/playing_time_conversion_efficiency_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:participation_threshold&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:fa_participation_requirement&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flat requirement, for granting permissions to non-EU players to obtain work permits and join English football clubs officially, used to be international-level participation of exactly 75% or more, over the past 24 months. But, in 2015, the requirements were re-assessed and subsequently updated to include tiers, based on the FIFA ranking of the particular non-EU country, whose passport is held by the footballer in question. Nevertheless, for the lowest ranking range, it is still required that the participation ratio, on international level, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inbrief.co.uk/football-law/footballer-work-permits/&quot;&gt;at least 75%&lt;/a&gt; for potential new signings. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 3 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/playing_time_conversion_efficiency_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:fa_participation_requirement&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:fpl_only&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namely, in the context of the Fantasy Premier League 2016/2017 selection pool, that's 164 players, out of 683 in total. It is noteworthy to mention Zlatan Ibrahimovic who, among others, didn't make the cut to be included into our conversion efficiency analysis, as he only played in 28 of Manchester United's Premier Leagues games. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 4 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/playing_time_conversion_efficiency_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:fpl_only&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:circle_area&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, for the purpose of facilitating visualisation clarity, I have exponentiated - by a constant - all player average values, in order to put further emphasis on the relative differences. Thus, please, note that the circle areas (or radii) do not correspond to the average values for the FPL 2016/2017 season, in a one-to-one fashion. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 5 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/playing_time_conversion_efficiency_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:circle_area&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is a part of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fantasy-football&quot;&gt;Fantasy Football&lt;/a&gt; team selection &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fpl-selection&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, where - as alluded previously - I aim to assist you in the best possible way in making your 2017/2018 picks, at pre-season time, as well as once the season has been kicked off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html&quot;&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt; our focus was on investigating how each player - among those ones who finished at the first 50 positions, ranked by highest overall points scored - contributed to the total points count of his team and, furthermore, his playing line within the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post, however, is more concerned with the actual playing characteristics of the leading&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:by_total_points&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fn:by_total_points&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; players, as observed in their overall statistics for the English Premier League 2016/2017 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;contribution_to_team_play&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#contribution_to_team_play&quot;&gt;Contribution to Team Play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly, we'll look at various attacking and defensive statistics&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:scored_goals_excluded&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fn:scored_goals_excluded&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of top players from different lines. In order to keep the analyses clean and uncluttered, I've decided to split the visualisations and commentary on a playing line basis; thus, this post is, essentially, the first in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/team-play-contributions&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, that will focus on individual contributions to team-play. We'll start by looking at the forwards, who have netted 150 points or more last season. They turn out to be 7 in total:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romelu Lukaku (221 points, avg. value £9.74)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harry Kane (220 points, avg. value £11.13)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diego Da Silva Costa (196 points, avg. value £10.38)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sergio Agüero (175 points, avg. value £12.88)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jermain Defoe (166 points, avg. value £7.54)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zlatan Ibrahimovic (163 points, avg. value £11.44)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jamie Vardy (161 points, avg. value £9.76)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, as in the entire &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fpl-selection&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, I've chosen to put forth, with utmost importance, self-explanatory plots, requiring the minimum amount of supplementary explanations that are only related to various technicalities, which cannot be explained solely by employing visual cues. Examples of such are characteristics of the given population sample, or of the scale axes etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As enlisted above, the play contribution plots are captioned, naturally, with the player name, along with the
total amount of points scored for the corresponding season, as well as the average transfer cost of that player (averaged over the cost of that player, corresponding to each individual gameweek). It is important to note here that the scale ranges/limits are fixed for all plots, for the purpose of enabling comparability between individual players. The maximum value along each scale is the greatest value that has been observed among &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; the seven forwards on focus (as the idea of the study is to find indicative characteristics, in a relative fashion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll briefly go over some significant observations, based on the graphs presented above, whilst leaving the conclusions, as well as transfer and selection decisions, as an exercise, entirely for you. Firstly, we can see that the most creative forwards are Costa, Lukaku and Ibrahimovic, with Kane following somehow closely in pursuit. In defensive plan, noteworthy mentions are Kane, Costa and Defoe, along with Ibrahimovic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the not so positive &quot;contributions&quot;, some sort of an indication (or validation in Agüero's case) can be inferred, regarding a player's injury proneness or lower capabilities for recovery from fatigue. Namely, Kane's, Agüero's, Ibrahimovic's and Vardy's performances are characterised by the lowest number of minutes played. This, in Kane's case automatically grants him the award of highest conversion efficiency, as he's the top goalscorer of last season, and a runner-up in the total points ranking, for his playing line (losing by just a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; point, to Romelu Lukaku, who played 831 minutes more than Kane did; this is 9.25 games!). This, essentially, reinforces the self-referential nature of this post by serving as a reminder that a player's output - in terms of goals, total points scored or otherwise - is largely a function of the collective contributions&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:playing_line_contributions&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fn:playing_line_contributions&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of those team-mates (whose output is also result of the same recursive process), who were part of the ten playing field players, at any given time, as well as the team synergy level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the spectrum, Jermaine Defoe, aged 34, spent the mind-bending 3322 playing minutes on the field, which when converted to number of games adds up to almost 37 games!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for today, folks! Good luck in the forthcoming Fantasy Premier League season, and stay tuned for more analysis and visualisations on the same topic. It may be a good idea to follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hristogeo&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, if you haven't done so already ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:by_total_points&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I maintain the opinion that the most useful analyses are those which invariably incorporate the notion of player output, as expressed in Fantasy Football terms, namely points scored (as this is the ultimate metric, based on which, all teams are ranked in the league standings, be it final or intermediate). Thus, it's always useful to reflect and, if possible, present a form of correlation analysis (or display) between the total points, possibly accompanied with its sister metric - player transfer value (or cost), and whatever discriminative features or statistics are utilised for analysing a subset of players. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 1 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:by_total_points&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:scored_goals_excluded&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, note that I've deliberately excluded the total number of goals scored, which by itself can be a misleading statistic, as it doesn't clearly indicate whether the goals in question were scored predominantly as a result of a player's attacking positioning, his finishing skill, his teammates' creativity or otherwise. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 2 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:scored_goals_excluded&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:interceptions&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;interceptions&lt;/em&gt; metric has been particularly defined to include the total number of clearances, blocks and interceptions, for a given player. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 3 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:interceptions&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:playing_line_contributions&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be further verified via referring to the study of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html&quot;&gt;total points contributions&lt;/a&gt;, which pays an honourable mention to the Tottenham midfield line, who were the highest scoring midfield line for FPL season 2016/2017, in terms of total number of points scored. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 4 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/team_play_contributions_of_the_top_forwards_for_the_fpl_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:playing_line_contributions&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the_underlying_idea&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#the_underlying_idea&quot;&gt;The Underlying Idea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_(Association)&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fantasy Football [is] a game in which participants assemble an imaginary team of real life footballers and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance or their perceived contribution on the field of play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, football aficionados make selections - subject to a pre-defined set of constraints (e.g., maximum number of players per team etc.) - which are a form of encoded predictions of how well a subset of the entire player pool will perform. Fantasy football managers usually enhance the selection process by following news outlets, and by performing statistical analyses of various degrees of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the_fantasy_premier_league&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#the_fantasy_premier_league&quot;&gt;The Fantasy Premier League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an entire &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fantasy-football&quot;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; on this blog, dedicated to analysis of fantasy football competitions, and predominantly targeting the portion of fantasy managers, who are interested in supplementing their knowledge and insights by delving into statistically-supported articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fpl-selection&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of posts, focused on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fantasy.premierleague.com/&quot;&gt;Fantasy Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, I'll attempt to assist you in improving selection (or verifying that it's already perfectly-polished!), or even create an initial one, based on statistical analysis or relatively simple heuristics. If you haven't created an account yet, it's probably a good idea to head over to the Fantasy Premier League's registration &lt;a href=&quot;https://users.premierleague.com/a/profile/register&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; and become a fantasy manager before the official start of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.premierleague.com/fixtures&quot;&gt;season&lt;/a&gt; (which is in the second week of August).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game organizers have conveniently provided a printable single-page &lt;a href=&quot;https://fantasy.premierleague.com/player-list/&quot;&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt; to the last season's performance (in terms of total number of points only, however) of the footballers which comprise the current transfer pool. One of the next posts, in my Fantasy Football &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fpl-selection&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, is specifically concerned with scraping and parsing that list, and proposes an algorithm for finding optimal selections, using the minimal information provided as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post, however, will focus on a bit deeper and more interesting look at last season's total points - we'll see how each one of the top 50 players ranks relative to his team-mates, as well as players from opponent teams. In other words, this study will provide insights into a player's degree of contribution, with respect to the same positional line &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fepl_positions&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#fn:fepl_positions&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as the entire squad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphs presented here contain information regarding overall contributions, in terms of total number of points&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fepl_points&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#fn:fepl_points&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The contributions are colour-coded, depending on  whether they represent player-only, line-only (i.e., the total point score of all goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders or forwards in a given team) or total team contributions. Particularly, the top 50, high-scoring, players are considered, and - in all graphs - the ordering of players is fixed, so that the highest scoring one is at the top, and the lowest scoring one - at the bottom, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Essentially, there are two sets of visualizations:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;absolute total number of points scored for each of the top 50 highest scoring players, their corresponding line, and their team total;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;relative number of points (in terms of percentage) that each player contributed to his playing line, along with the contribution of that line to the team total.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of providing some sort of a temporal dimension, and a better idea as to how each individual player, line and team ranked as time went by, each of the two sets of plots is further subdivided into three categories (each alloted a dedicated bar chart): contribution across the entire 2016/2017 season, and in each half, separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this context, the graphs become more or less self-explanatory, enabling one to draw straightforward conclusions. We can clearly see the total domination of Sánchez (264 points), who was the winner of the season, with a remarkable performance in the midfield line of Arsenal, while neither of the latter were on the top 2 positions in their corresponding rankings (the respective scores were 1044 and 2015 points, for the Arsenal midfield line, and the team overall). The runner-up, Hazard (224 points), also demonstrated significant contribution in Chelsea's midfield line (952 points), which itself didn't rank nearly as high as those of Liverpool (1214 points) and Manchester City (1153 points).
While this study is not focused on player transfer values, it is imperative to point your attention towards Swansea's Sigurdsson, whose average value was only £7.42. Nevertheless, he managed to contribute by a rate higher than that of Sánchez to his corresponding midfield line, and managed to net 181 points in total - for reference, that was only 15 less
than Diego Costa from Chelsea. However, the average total value of the latter was £10.42, while that of Arsenal's Alexis Sánchez was even higher - £11.51.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along an analogous chain of reasoning, we see a clear justification for Lukaku's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40550934&quot;&gt;£75m transfer&lt;/a&gt; to Manchester United this summer. The forward finished at the top in his playing line (221 points), and his contributions were greater in proportion - 12.5% vs. 10% and 16.3% vs. 12.5% - relative to his runner-up, Harry Kane (220 points).
The latter, team-based comparison provides indication of Lukaku's significant contribution, from within a context of lower degree of support from his team-mates, as reflected in Everton's total points, 1771, in contrast to the 2194 scored by all Tottenham players, making them the winning team of the last season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these are just a few examples of head-to-head analysis, intended to supplement your selection-making strategy. As mentioned above, the plots themselves speak much more than a thousand words, by themselves only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this post has managed to deepen your insights into last season's top player performance, in terms of total number of points scored. For this purpose, I presented a multi-dimensional view, providing information as to how a given player ranked, on the overall, relative to teammates with the most similar tasks and responsibilities&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:football_strategy&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#fn:football_strategy&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as competing players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In further posts from the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/tagged/fpl-selection&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, we'll look into various other statistics and metrics, accompanied by descriptive visualizations, for the very same
purpose stated above - assisting you, the reader, in making the best possible selection for the next game-week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn:fepl_positions&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Fantasy Premier League game, all players are divided into 4 categories of positions, which are fixed for the entire course of the season. Every player
can be assigned only one position from the following list: goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and forward. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 1 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:fepl_positions&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:fepl_points&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://fantasy.premierleague.com/help/&quot;&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt; on point scoring, navigate to the &lt;em&gt;Rules&lt;/em&gt; tab, and then the &lt;em&gt;Scoring&lt;/em&gt; section. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 2 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:fepl_points&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn:football_strategy&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, whilst providing statistically-backed informational value, this statement is a wild over-generalization, when we consider the
elaborate nature of modern football strategies and formations, where individual instructions and tasks vary both along temporal, intra- as well as inter-match, scales. &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 3 in the text&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://hristog.github.io/fantasy_football_total_points_contributions_for_season_2016_2017.html#fnref:football_strategy&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
