Can't remember which one it was exactly, but if you'd like to familiarise yourself with its particular design decisions,\nadvantages, disadvantages, features, etc., you might want to head over to HackerNews and give a quick skim over the following comment threads: [1][termux_hn_1], [2][termux_hn_2], [3][termux_hn_3], [4][termux_hn_4], [5][termux_hn_5].\n\nIf you opted to do a Depth-First-Search of the above articles, then I may have already lost you as a reader already. If, however, you didn't get put off by my desperate attempts at humor, and somehow found your way back to this post, then welcome back. `else # i.e., you prefer synthesized content`, keep reading :).\n\n# Python[^google_play_screenshot] on Termux\nOnce you've got Termux [installed][termux_google_play] in your Android environment, you simply need a\ncouple of straightforward steps[^termux_permissions] to update your packages and install Python. Fortunately, Termux provides support for both versions of Python - v2 (intensely branded as \"Legacy Python\" in the recent history of the language) and v3.\n\n[^google_play_screenshot]: Never mind that the bottom tab, in the Google Play screenshot displayed above, is occupied by source code in another programming language (which we'll pretend we're unfamiliar with, and looks like a variety of Assembly langauge to us), which for all intents and purposes of this post can be thought of as Python :)\n\n[^termux_permissions]: Keep in mind you'll need to enable access and write storage permissions at\nthe app level, for Termux.\n\n```bash\n$ apt update && apt upgrade\n$ termux-setup-storage\n$ pkg install python\n$ pkg install python2\n```\n\nUpon successful completion of the above steps, you should be able to [access][termux_storage] your Python scripts and other files from `$HOME/storage`.\n\n# `pip` gotcha's\n\nAs you probably have guessed already, each Python package comes hand in hand with its accompanying `pip` utility: `pip` for Python v3 and `pip2` for \"Legacy Python\".\n\nHowever, observe the following check-with-a-pawn kind of situation:\n```shell\n$ pip --version\npip 9.0.1 from /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)\n$ pip2 --version\npip 9.0.1 from /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)\n```\n\n[Cowabunga][cowabunga]! Both `pip` package managers are associated with Python 2.7 and none with\nnon-\"Legacy Python\". This may arise if you updated `pip2` which then overwrites the `pip` reference itself.\n\nFear not, young Houdini's, tomorrow never dies! There's an escape from this one, too. Simply use:\n```bash\n$ python -m pip install <package>\n$ python2 -m pip install <package>\n```\n\nYou can subsequently turn these into aliases, and add to your `$HOME/.bashrc` via:\n```bash\nalias pip_install=python -m pip install\nalias pip_install2=python2 -m pip install\n```\n\n# Editing your scripts\n\nBeing a multi-functional terminal emulator, Termux does provide support for\ntraditional editors such as `vi` and `vim`. However, despite the [built-in][termux_keyboard]\nkey(-combination) equivalents to full-fledged keyboards (physical or otherwise), I've found the use\nof CLI-based text editors[^vim_vs_emacs] to be a bit awkward without an external keyboard.\n\n[^vim_vs_emacs]: No, I do not intend to dive into a detailed dispute of the eternal\nVim-vs-Emacs question. But Vim is the better one ... :)\n\nFor the purpose of editing my Python scripts, I've found [DroidEdit][droid_edit_google_play]\nto do the job just well enough. Of course, Google will probably be able to provide you\ndetailed comparisons, reviews, trade-offs and alternatives. But you wouldn't go wrong if you give DroidEdit a go, as a first attempt.\n\n[termux]: https://termux.com/\n[termux_keyboard]: https://termux.com/touch-keyboard.html\n[termux_storage]: https://termux.com/storage.html\n[termux_google_play]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux\n[droid_edit_google_play]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aor.droidedit\n[termux_hn_1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9905391\n[termux_hn_2]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11572939\n[termux_hn_3]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15529426\n[termux_hn_4]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11570596\n[termux_hn_5]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11459355\n[cowabunga]: http://turtlepedia.wikia.com/wiki/Cowabunga_(catchphrase)\n",
